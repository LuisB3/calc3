    <ul>
        <li><span><b>Class</b></span> - a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class.
            The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.</li>
        <li><span><b>Class Method</b></span> - a method that is bound to the class and not to the object of the class. It takes a class parameter that points to the
            actual class and not the object instance. They are generally used to create factory methods.</li>
        <li><span><b>Class Variable</b></span> - a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but
            outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.</li>
        <li><span><b>Constructor</b></span> - the creation of an instance of a class.</li>
        <li><span><b>Data Member</b></span> - a class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.</li>
        <li><span><b>Design Patterns</b></span> - a common way of solving well known problems. They represent the best ways to structure your code to achieve the
            desired outcome, particularly for creating and defining classes, methods, objects, etc.</li>
        <li><span><b>Facade</b></span> - a design pattern that allows an interface or class to create an object but lets subclasses decide which class or object to
            instantiate. It allows objects to be created without exposing the logic to the user, and allows the user to use the same common interface each time.</li>
        <li><span><b>Factory</b></span> - is an object for creating other objects.  A subroutine that returns a "new" object
            may be referred to as a "factory", as in factory method or factory function. This is a basic concept in OOP, and forms the basis for a number
            of related software design patterns.</li>
        <li><span><b>Fixture</b></span> - provides a defined and consistent context for each test. In Pytest, they are functions that we define for this purpose.</li>
        <li><span><b>Function Overloading</b></span> - the assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies
            by the types of objects or arguments involved.</li>
        <li><span><b>Instance Variable</b></span> - a variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.</li>
        <li><span><b>Inheritance</b></span> - the transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.</li>
        <li><span><b>Instance</b></span> - An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example,
            is an instance of the class Circle.</li>
        <li><span><b>Instantiation</b></span> - the creation of an instance of a class.</li>
        <li><span><b>Method</b></span> - a special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>
        <li><span><b>Namespace</b></span> - an object-oriented concept which allows for organization of variables, functions, and other
            elements of a program. It encapsulates code such that to access that code, you must first reference the namespace to which you are
            referring. Programmers can create other namespaces, thus organizing code and reducing pollution of the global namespace.</li>
        <li><span><b>Object</b></span> - a unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members
            (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</li>
        <li><span><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b></span> - a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code:
            data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.</li>
        <li><span><b>Operator Overloading</b></span> - the assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.</li>
        <li><span><b>Property</b></span> - the creation of an instance of a class.</li>
        <li><span><b>Static Method</b></span> - a method that is bound to the class and not to the object of the class. A static method cannot access or modify the
            state of a class, unlike a class method, and are generally used to create utility functions for a class.</li>
        <li><span><b>Type Cast</b></span> - involves the act of changing one data type into another. For example, converting an "int" into a "float".</li>
        <li><span><b>Type Hint</b></span> - an annotation that specifies the expected type for a variable, a class attribute, or a function parameter.
            Type hints are optional and not enforced by Python but can be very useful.</li>
        <li><span><b>Unit Test</b></span> - a software testing method by which individual units of source code are put under various tests to determine whether they
            perform as intended.</li>
    </ul>
